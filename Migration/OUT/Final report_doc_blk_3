uting servers. 3. New trend in business world and scientific community – In recent times the business enterprises are interested in discovering customer needs, buying patterns, supply chains to take top management decisions. These require analysis of very large amount of online data. This can be done with the help of cloud very easily. Yahoo! Homepage is a very good example of such thing. In the homepage they show the hottest news in the country. And according to the users’ interest they change the ads and other sections in the page. Other than these many scientific experiments need very time consuming data processing jobs like LHC (Large Hadron Collider).  4. Extensive desktop application – Some desktop applications like Matlab, Mathematica are becoming so compute intensive that a single desktop machine is no longer enough to run them. So they are developed to be capable of using cloud computing to perform extensive evaluations.Cloud computing has already provided considerable capabilities for scalable, highly reliable, and easy to deploy environment for its clients. Nevertheless, the benefits of interconnected Cloud environments for both Cloud providers and their clients are numerous and there are essential motivations for Cloud interoperability, which will eventually lead to the Inter-Cloud. The key benefits of an Inter-Cloud environment are Scalability and Wider Resource Availability.Interoperability and Avoiding Vendor Lock-in Availability and Disaster Recovery Cloud.1.2 SCOPECloud computing is a convenient, on-demand model for network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. Conceptually it refers to a model of scalable, real-time, internet-based information technology services and resources, satisfying the computing needs of users, without the users incurring the
