h the big data movement.1.3 ObjectivesProtect Postal Service data from unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, and monitoring. This includes supporting identity management such that the Postal Service has the capability to enforce identity and access control policies on authorized users accessing cloud services. This also includes the ability of the Postal Service to allow access to its data selectively available to other users.Protect information resources from supply chain threats. This includes verifying and maintaining the trustworthiness and reliability of the CP, as well as the security assurances associated with the hardware and software used.Prevent unauthorized access to cloud computing infrastructure resources. This includes implementing security domains that have a logical separation between computing resources (e.g., logical separation of Postal Service workloads running on the same physical server by virtual machine (VM) monitors [hypervisors] in a multitenant environment) and using default to no-access configurations.Implementing data-migration compatibility tool, to check the compatibility between the clouds and also enabling the data migration between the cloud.CHAPTER 2LITERATURE REVIEWCloud computing can be regarded to a certain degree, as the evolution of grid computing. Such a close relationship has caused confusion. The grid framework is originally driven by scientific purposes, and aimed at coordinating resources that are not subject to centralised control under standard, open, general-purpose protocols and interfaces.Cloud computing is born for commercial purposes and naturally service oriented. It is based on centralised data centres. The protocols and interfaces used may not be the same across clouds providers. 20th Australasian Conference on Information Systems  Melbourne Yang & Tate 808 Cloud computing has completely distinct business model. It offers clear SLAs and is based on a “pay per use” pricing model. Gr
