treating objects as objects rather than nodes in a hierarchical tree. At present, I don’t believe there is a reasonable solution to the problem that isn’t also proprietary. We need to develop one that is open and free.2.9 “Root”, If RequiredThe cloud computer vendor can’t think of everything a developer or application might need or want to do. So the cloud needs to be hackable and extensible by the developer and that means an administrative account of some sort that allows the developer to shape and mold the cloud to their specific needs. By definition, cloud computers must be built on top of some sort of virtualization technology, so the developer never has “root” to the cloud, only “root” to the developer’s part of the cloud.Chapter 3System Analysis and Design3.1 Hardware Requirement80GB or more space in hard disk1GB RAM or more32Bit Processor or 64BitNetwork connection with 1Mbps or more3.2 Software RequirementWindows XP/7/8/8.1/10EclipseCloudsimAWS tool kit for eclipseThe above figure presents a high level view of the NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture (CCRA), which identifies the major actors (Cloud Consumer, Cloud Service Provider, Cloud Auditor, Cloud Broker, and Cloud Carrier), their activities and functions in cloud computing. A cloud consumer may request cloud services from a cloud provider directly or via a cloud broker. A cloud auditor conducts independent audits and may contact the others to collect necessary information.Chapter 4Preliminary ResultsWe went through different types of cloud services provided by various service providers and then we used Amazon  EC2 Cloud  to deploy a java application on it and made observations on Uploading  and storing application files.Examination and storing of application metadata.Creation of  “droplet” for the application.Selects an appropriate droplet execution agent (DEA) to run the droplet.Starting the application.Chapter 5Conclusion and Future
