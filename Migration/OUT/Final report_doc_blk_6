id computing on the other hand is based on a sharing system, that is, one needs to join the grid and contribute computing power to gain access to the computing power of other members. In this co-operative model, SLAs are not required or enforceable. In this paper, we see cloud computing is based on a large pool of easily usable and accessible virtualisedThese resources are typically built in centralised data centres and are dynamically re-configured to achieve an optimum utilization. Clouds are provided by a pay-as-you-go model in which guarantees are offered by the providers by means of customized SLAs This turns computing power into a public utility which will bring a profound paradigm shift to the IT industry and even to society as a whole. Cloud computing has promised many technological and sociological benefits. The computing power is generated from highly centralised and standardized data centres which contain up to millions of servers, with a considerable economy of scale. From an enterprise standpoint, cloud computing can deliver on-demand computing power at a very low if not any cost of the upfront infrastructure and ongoing maintenance. Cloud computing also promises to provide better performance, reliability and scalability. There is some evidence that these are being delivered.From an environmental standpoint, owing to the advanced electrical and cooling systems used by its centralised data centres, cloud computing has promised to bring low environmental cost and high energy efficiency, compared to the traditional scattered enterprise data centres. All in all, these promises have drawn drastically increasing attention of a world wide scale.2.1 Virtualization Layer Network StabilityCloud computers must operate on some sort of virtualization technology for many of the following features to even be feasible. But as general purpose computing moves from dedicated hardware to on-demand computing, one key feature of the dedicated model for web applications i
