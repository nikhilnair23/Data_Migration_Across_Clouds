WorkThe current version is draft and supports basic functionalities in implementing our application on the cloud platform and deploying it and also to integrate the inter-clouds that is deployed into a cloud. The proposed model integrates services to facilitate inter-cloud communication in a common platform in order to list all available services, instances, offer network capabilities, security and deployment of IaaS services. The experimental prototype demonstrates the basic configurations in order to develop an application and deploying it on cloud. Since this is an ongoing effort more information could be found. we focus on the development of the proposed model in order to include all services and components, and to develop a graphical user interface to provide a common management platform that will be offered as a service instance. In addition, extra effort will be made to the characterization of performance metrics  in order to provide optimization algorithms. we aim to explore security issues and interoperability issues in order to optimize performance. Finally, we will explore other IEEE papers and APIs in order to expand the inter-cloud services.Bibliography[1]. A. Sheth and A. Ranabahu, "Semantic Modelling for cloud computing.
