The advent of the enthusiasm about cloud computing in recent past is due to some recent technology trend and business models.1. High demand of interactive applications – Applications with real time response and with capability of providing information either by other users or by nonhuman sensors gaining more and more popularity today. These are generally attracted to cloud not only because of high availability but also because these services are generally data intensive and require analyzing data across different sources. 2. Parallel batch processing – Cloud inherently supports batch-processing and analyzing tera-bytes of data very efficientlyopen source counter partHadoopcan be used to do these hiding operational complexity of parallel processing of hundreds of cloud comp
